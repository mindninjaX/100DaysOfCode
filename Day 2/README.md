# Day 2 of 100DaysOfCode

## What I learned?

I learned the following topics :
- CSS Properties
-  CSS Selectors
- Box Model 
- Difference between px, em & rem

## What I develop?

I created a simple Spotify Dashboard which displays the favourite songs, playlists & podcast using HTML & CSS. It was a bit challenging again but at the same time we had a lot of fun building it.
