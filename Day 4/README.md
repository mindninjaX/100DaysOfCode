# Day 4 of 100DaysOfCode

## What I learned?

I learned the following topics :
- Introduction to Bootstrap
- How to use website templates
- Mailchimp Implementation
- Deploying on GitHub Pages

## What I develop?

I created a simple Adventure Blog using Bootstrap & some CSS with Flexbox. I personally think that Bootstrap is a great tool but I enjoyed making websites more with HTML & CSS. <br> I am only gonna use it occasionally.
